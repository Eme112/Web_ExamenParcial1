    <h3>TIMELINE</h3>
    <div id="dates">
      <p><span class="date">1792-1802</span>: Vienna - the early years. Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour.</p>
      <p><span class="date">1802-1812</span>: The 'heroic' period. Beethoven's return to Vienna from Heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style, and is now often designated as the start of his middle or "heroic" period, characterised by many original works composed on a grand scale.</p>
      <p><span class="date">1813-1822</span>: Acclaim. In early 1813 Beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period, and his compositional output dropped. His personal appearance degraded—it had generally been neat—as did his manners in public, notably when dining.</p>
      <p><span class="date">1823-1827</span>:  The final years. The year 1823 saw the completion of three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years, namely the Missa solemnis, the Ninth Symphony and the Diabelli Variations.</p>
